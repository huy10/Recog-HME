Recog-HME
=========

This is the code for the recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions, written by Yang Hu and Yejun Tang.

The framework could be referenced as from potcharacter.cpp to hmcSegment.cpp, then hmcSegmentgmm.cpp, then RecoCore.cpp and finally, hmcAnalyse.cpp. Please see the individual file for details.

Mainly written by Yang Hu and Yejun Tang. And Professor Liangrui Peng contributes a lot for the recog core and insights.
